# Conduent Tech Challenge 
 
This isn’t a formal test, it’s just an exercise. It should take between 60 and 90 minutes. 
 
Create a C# or F# Console application which takes a monetary value as input and returns that value expressed in words as an output. 
 

 
## User Story 
 
*As A* User, I want to *convert monetary values to words*. 
 
### Example -  
 
On running the application, I type £3,496,002.08 
 
The console responds - “three million, four hundred and ninety-six thousand and two pounds and eight pence” 

 
### Acceptance Criteria 
 
- The console application returns the correct values 
- The console application treats alpha characters as zero and returns accordingly 
- The console application returns an out-of-range message if the number entered is negative or is greater than or equal to 10^9 (1,000,000,000). 
 

We’re looking for 
- clean code 
- minimal allocations 
- readable unit tests 
- low developer cunning
